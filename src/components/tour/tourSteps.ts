// This is the ONLY file you edit to change the walkthrough. The narration card
// (TourOverlay.tsx) reads this list and never needs to change when the flow does.
//
// Each step:
//   route  - the page the tour navigates to for this step
//   title  - short heading shown in the card
//   body   - detailed, benefit-led explanation of what the page/section does
//   target - (optional) CSS selector for the element to gently ring. Append
//            " @N" to pick the Nth match, e.g. "main table @3". If omitted, the
//            first real content block on the page is ringed.
//   click  - (optional) CSS selector (same " @N" syntax) of an element to click
//            when the step opens - used to reveal in-page views like the machine
//            tabs before ringing their content.
//
// The tour is a light, non-blocking narration: it navigates to each page, leaves
// the real page fully visible and usable, rings the relevant content, and
// explains the benefit in a corner card.
//
// NOTE: /routes/[id], /locations/[id] and /trips/[id] are deliberately omitted -
// they currently render the wrong screen (see DEMO_SCRIPT.md). Add them here once
// those pages are fixed.
